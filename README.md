# notion-api-automation

Here are some useful scripts to automate notion and interact with it programmatically.


The recurring_tasks.py is the main script that will copy items from one database and place them in another. 

The first database should be the one that is set up with the recurring tasks that you want with a table structure that has the following properties: 


1) Task Name
2) Day of Week (Multi-select with the days of the week) 
3) Day of Month (Multi-select with numbers 1-28 to represent each day of a month)
